					<p>My first real job experience came my freshman year of college working at the National Institute for Aviation Research. In the Spring of 2019, I began as a mechanical tester of Composite Laminate Specimens utilizing test methods provided by ASTM. I worked on projects for companies such as Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing, NASA, and more.</p>
					<p>After about 18 months as a tester, an opportunity arose for me to transition groups to learn automation. This transition was extremely formative for me as I learned to use industry-standard automation equipment like Siemens Programmable Logic Controllers as well as Kuka robots. I was also exposed to and worked with various aircraft composite inspection methods such as Thermography, Shearography and Laser Paint Removal. Rapid prototyping and developent, leadership, task dissemination, teamwork, and maintaining professional relationships with our vendors were crucial skills I learned on top of my technical training. </p>				
					<p>While in this position I was regarded highly on my project team, facilitating meetings with vendors and being given the opportunity to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6912535877940334592/">travel to Corpus Christi Texas</a> to assist in installing our project. However, after 21 months on the project, I decided that it was time for me to further my Cyber Security Career, and left to pursue an internship at Koch Industries as a Cyber Security Architect Inter. I am grateful for the time I spent at NIAR and the relationships I was able to create with some of the fantastic people there.</p>

				<!-- About -->
				<article id="about">
					<h2 class="major">About</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/jon-img1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>I was born and raised in Wichita, but have family both there and in Cincinnati. I attended Kapaun Mount Carmel High School as part of the Class of 2018, and stayed active mostly with sports, being a team captain of the football team my senior year, as well as travelling to various states to play lacrosse.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/img-abt2-scaled.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Though I graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security from Wichita State University in the Fall of 2022, my studies have been multidisciplinary. I have recieved a minor in Psycology from Wichita State, as well as Certificates in Data and Web Security, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Human Factors in Cybersecurity.</p>
					<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/fraternity.jpeg" alt="" /></span>-->
					<p>At Wichita State I was part of the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and the experiences I shared with those guys were wonderful. I held executive positions as the Recruitment Chairman, the Member Edcuator, and the Health and Safety Chairman. On top of that, I was the Chapter Delegate to our biennial Nationwide Convention, held in Louisville, Kentucky in the Summer of 2019.</p>
					<p>Within the next few months, my breadth of knowledge of the cybersecurity field will grow due to the beginning of an internship with Koch Industries, just up the road from my childhood home. </p>
